## Problem statement
● Inefficient Information Management: Manual capture and organization of patient-doctor conversations can be time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to inefficiencies in healthcare delivery.

● Limited Personalization: Providing personalized healthcare recommendations based on individual patient symptoms and medical history is challenging, particularly in high-volume healthcare settings where time constraints are prevalent.

● Communication Barriers: Effective communication between patients and healthcare professionals is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment. However, language barriers, medical jargon, and limited consultation time often impede this process, hindering the quality of care provided.
